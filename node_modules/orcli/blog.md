# Introducing Orcli, the Orchestrate CLI

[node]: https://nodejs.org
[github]: https://github.com/orchestrate-io/orcli

I must love BASH programming because I keep building CLIs. I mean, you can do such cool stuff with them! Check this out:

	cat item.json | orcli post items

That creates one item in the database, turning the `item.json` file into the body of the item in the database. That's convenient, but we can do so much more.

Say you want to log events from a machine every hour. Well, open up your crontab with `crontab -e` and add a line like this:

	@hourly orcli event sensors $SENSOR_ID status create --status=$SENSOR_STATUS

Every hour, this script will add a new event for the given sensor, reporting its current status. *That was all the coding necessary.* Let's get that event back:
	
	orcli event sensors $SENSOR_ID status $TIMESTAMP $ORDINAL
	# {
	# 	"status": "$SENSOR_STATUS"
	# }

There it is! Can you begin to see THE POWER?

Before I keep on, I want you to set this up yourself. If you've already got [node.js][node] installed, just do this: (otherwise, install [node][node]!)

	npm install -g orcli

Orcli will tell you all about how to use it with `orcli --help`.

To get started, you'll want to give Orcli the API key you want to use, like this:

	orcli use $YOUR_API_KEY

This sets the current API key to the one you provided, so future calls will use it to authenticate automatically.

Orcli saves API keys in `~/.orcli` so you don't have to remember them, and can assign aliases so you can easily switch between working with different applications:

	orcli use $ANOTHER_API_KEY blog
	# now using named key 'blog'
	orcli use $YET_ANOTHER_KEY
	# now using an unnamed key
	orcli use blog
	# now using named key 'blog'

If you want to use an API key without setting or saving it, use the `--api-key` flag to specify, like this:

	orcli merge people diana --is_a_babe=true --api-key=$YOUR_API_KEY

That executes a PATCH request that sets the field `is_a_babe` on the given person to true, while authenticating with the given API key without referencing the keys saved in `./~orcli`.

Like it? For more information, check out the [source code][github]! Patches, issues, and comments are all welcome.
